# Teaching Repository

Welcome to my **Teaching** repository! This collection contains lecture slides, supplementary materials, and source files I've created for teaching topics related to **Statistics, Mathematics, Machine Learning, and Artificial Intelligence**. The content is designed to be flexible, with opportunities for contributions and modifications, especially for those who want to expand or adjust the materials to suit their teaching styles.

## Repository Structure

The repository contains resources related to the following topics,

- **Statistics**: Materials covering basic to advanced statistical techniques.
- **Mathematics**: Concepts ranging from algebra to advanced mathematical theory.
- **Machine Learning**: Covering supervised, unsupervised, and deep learning methodologies with examples and applications.
- **Artificial Intelligence**: Includes topics on theory, ethical considerations, and modern AI techniques.
- **Philosophy (Occasional)**: Occasional mention or lecture on the intersection of philosophy and other disciplines covered in this repository.

Each folder may contain:
- **Lecture slides** (`.pdf`)
- **Source files** (`.Rmd`, `.html`, `.css`)
- **Jupyter notebooks** (`.ipynb`) for live coding sessions
- **Datasets** used for statistical or machine learning demonstrations
