#Summation

<img src="./media/sum.png" alt = "Summation" height="120px"/>

####where <i>i</i> is the index of summation; <i>a<sub>i</sub></i> is an indexed variable representing each term of the sum; <i>m</i> is the lower bound of summation, and <i>n</i> is the upper bound of summation. The "<i>i = m</i>" under the summation symbol means that the index <i>i</i> starts out equal to <i>m</i>. The index, <i>i</i>, is incremented by one for each successive term, stopping when <i>i = n</i>.


---
##Example
#Summation

####The summation of $i$ from $i = 1$ to $3$ is:

$$
\sum_{i=1}^{3} i
$$

####The summation of $i^2$ from $i = 3$ to $6$ is:

$$
\sum_{i=3}^{6} i^2
$$

####The summation of $\frac{1}{2^n}$ from $i = 0$ to $\infty$ is:

$$
\sum_{i=0}^{\infty} \frac{1}{2^n}
$$

---
##Example
#Summation

####The summation of $i$ from $i = 1$ to $3$ is:

$$
\sum_{i=1}^{3} i = 1 + 2 + 3 = 6
$$

####The summation of $i^2$ from $i = 3$ to $6$ is:

$$
\sum_{i=3}^{6} i^2 = 3^2 + 4^2 + 5^2 + 6^2 = 86
$$

####The summation of $\frac{1}{2^n}$ from $i = 0$ to $\infty$ is:

$$
\sum_{i=0}^{\infty} \frac{1}{2^n} = \frac{1}{1} + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{4} + ... = 2 \quad\text{(Convergent series!)}

#Normal Distribution

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="./media/normal_distribution.png" alt = "Normal Distribution Definition" height="120px"/></p>

#### where <em>x</em> represents a variable, <em>μ</em> is the mean of the distribution, <em>σ</em> is the standard deviation, <em>σ<sup>2</sup></em> is the variance, and <em>e</em> is Euler's number, the base of the natural logarithms. The normal distribution is symmetrical, with a bell-shaped curve where the majority of observations cluster around the mean, and probabilities for <em>x</em> taper off symmetrically in both directions from the mean

### **Are there other distributions?**

---
### **Are there other distributions?**
- Poisson Distribution
- Heavy-Tailed Distribution
- Tukey's Lambda Distribution
- Exponential Distribution
- Uniform Distribution
- Binomial Distribution
- Geometric Distribution
- Beta Distribution

####Each distribution has its own unique properties and applications, ranging from modeling the number of events occurring in a fixed interval of time or space (Poisson Distribution), to describing outcomes with only two possible values (Binomial Distribution), to modeling waiting times (Exponential Distribution), ...

### **What tools exist to help with data cleaning, modeling, and analysis?**

<table style="width:100%; margin-top: 20px;">
  <tr>
    <td style="width:50%;"><img src="./media/R_logo.png" alt="R Logo" height="120px"/><br><strong style="font-size: larger;">R</strong></td>
    <td style="width:50%;"><img src="./media/Python_logo.png" alt="Python Logo" height="120px"/><br><strong font-size: larger;>Python</strong></td>
  </tr>
</table>

####and other point and click software like Jamovi and SPSS for those who would prefer as little programming as possible. Note that there are many other languages available for data analysis other than R and Python though today these are the two most often used languages for this purpose.

### **How can I learn to code with open-source?**
<p>With <em>open source</em> through GitHub, you can host and review code, manage projects, and build software alongside 50 million developers.</p>

<p><strong>Pros of Open Source for Learning:</strong></p>
- <strong>Collaboration:</strong> Engage with a community of learners and developers.
- <strong>Transparency:</strong> Access the source code and understand the inner workings.
- <strong>Diversity of Projects:</strong> Contribute to projects that range from beginner-friendly to advanced.
- <strong>Real-World Experience:</strong> Work on projects that are used in the real world.
- <strong>Resources and Tools:</strong> Utilize a plethora of free tools and resources available for learning.
